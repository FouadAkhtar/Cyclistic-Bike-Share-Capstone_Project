# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Capstone_Project
Introduction
This capstone project marked the culmination of the Google Data Analytics Certificate program on Coursera. Its primary aim was to demonstrate the practical application of the acquired skills throughout the course. In this endeavor, I assumed the role of a junior data analyst within the fictional bike-share company, Cyclistic.

About Cyclistic
Back in 2016, Cyclistic successfully introduced a bike-sharing initiative. Over time, the program has expanded, boasting a fleet of 5,824 geo-tracked bicycles stationed across 692 locations throughout Chicago. These bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station within the network at the convenience of the riders.

Scenario at Hand
Historically, Cyclistic’s marketing endeavors predominantly centered on enhancing brand recognition. Lily Moreno, the director of marketing, now envisions Cyclistic’s future triumph linked to the growth of annual memberships, which tend to yield higher profits compared to occasional riders who opt for day passes or single-ride tickets.

Moreno posits that targeting the casual riders is paramount, given their existing familiarity with Cyclistic’s yearly program and their prior engagement with the service. This prompts Moreno to shift focus toward converting these casual riders into annual members for upcoming marketing initiatives.

As a data analyst, I am entrusted by Moreno and the Cyclistic team to delve into past trip data, thus empowering their strategic decisions.

This brings us to the central inquiry guiding this project:

Business Task
The key business task for this project is to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. This analysis will provide insights that can inform future marketing strategies, particularly in converting casual riders to annual members.

Project
This project is aimed at deriving answers and recommendations for our business task.

The project itself encompasses five distinct phases: Preparation, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

Preparation involves dealing with the raw data: its origin and the necessary steps to ready it for this project.

In the Process phase, I’ll outline the tools utilized for this project and detail the procedures undertaken to preprocess the data in preparation for analysis.

During the Analyze phase, I delve into data examination, extracting initial insights and determining the most effective data arrangement for visualization.

Moving on to the Share phase, I employ R to create crucial visualizations that underpin the recommendations I provide to the Cyclistic team.

Lastly, the Act phase marks the project’s culmination. Here, I present my suggestions on optimizing Cyclistic’s approach to engaging casual riders, along with potential follow-up actions for future marketing endeavors.

Having established the background of Cyclistic and the associated business task, we will now progress through each of these project phases systematically to arrive at a well-informed conclusion for the benefit of the Cyclistic team.
